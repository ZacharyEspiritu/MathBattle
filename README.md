# MathBattle
**Winner for "Best UI Design" at Local Hack Day 2015 @ General Assembly.** An iOS game where two players compete to solve procedurally generating, math-based puzzles as fast as possible. 

## Description

Nowadays, getting children (and adults!) to play "educational games" can be hard to nearly impossible. That's where Math Battle comes in. It's an iOS game where two players go head-to-head in a battle of intellect attempting to solve automatically generating, math-based puzzles faster than the other player. The competitive aspect of the game makes it fun yet engrossing and educational for players of all ages.

The game's shining component is its procedural puzzle generation system. Every time you play, a new puzzle is generated with a guaranteed solution. This allows for massive replayability, so you can challenge your enemies and math teachers to a Math Battle as many times as you want and still get new puzzles every time.

Coming very soon to an iOS App Store near you. (Sorry, Android users.)

## Stuff To Do

* Add difficulty option
* Add single player "campaign mode" (think *4 Pics 1 Word* but for math!)
* Determine if it's feasible to implement synchronous two-player over the internet via Game Center
* Make it more awesome
